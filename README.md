My corpus will circle around 2 comparison points, namely genre and geographical location. Two key genres (Hip-hop and Afrobeats) will be paralleled to identify differences and/or similarities between each other. In addition, I would also attempt to study the evolution of each genre from the 90s to its current nature. Two geographical regions I would like to explore and compare in this corpus would be Africa (Afrobeats/Afrofusion) versus America (American hip-hop). A question Iâ€™d like to investigate further is if there has been a shift in the African sound to appeal to a western audience in the last five to ten years. I hope to evaluate this query by placing purer Afrobeat against more contemporary Afrofusion and then against American hip-hop. 


the plot included compares the speechiness, energy and valence of contemporary Hip Hop (last 15 years). it is shown that speechiness increases with valence. also as expected higher energy tracks have higher speechiness.
